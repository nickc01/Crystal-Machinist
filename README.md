Crystal Machinist is a hollow knight mod that takes the existing Enraged Guardian fight and makes it far more interesting and difficult. 

Crystal Machinist now utilities much of the machinery found in Crystal Peaks to take you down! 

The fight also has multiple phases, with each phase getting harder and harder.

Requires Modding API to be installed
